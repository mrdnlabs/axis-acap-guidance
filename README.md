# ACAP Development Knowledge Base

Standards, reusable prompts, and hard-won learnings for developing [Axis ACAP](https://developer.axis.com/acap/) applications — with a focus on agentic (AI-assisted) development workflows.

This is a vendor-neutral knowledge base distilled from real ACAP projects. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Axis Communications. Technical claims were verified against official Axis documentation, but the platform moves quickly — **always confirm against the docs and your target firmware**, especially anything tied to a specific SDK or AXIS OS version.

> _Last verified: June 2026, against AXIS OS 12.x / ACAP Native SDK 12.x. See the **References** section in each document for the official sources behind its claims._

## Start here

If you're beginning a new ACAP project, work through the set in this order:

1. **Gate 0 — [suitability](./standards/acap-project-suitability.md):** is this even a good fit for a custom ACAP? Resolve any STOP/CAUTION first.
2. **Kickstart — [go-to prompt](./standards/acap-project-go-to-prompt.md):** start an agentic session with the right research-first, test-on-device workflow.
3. **Build — [development standards](./standards/acap-development-standards.md):** follow the conventions; reach for the [Guides](#guides) when you hit a specific API or build issue.
4. **Validate — [security audit](./standards/acap-security-audit.md):** run the checklists before you publish.

The **Standards** are normative (what to do, in order); the **Guides** are descriptive platform knowledge (how a specific thing actually behaves). Each guide ends with a **References** section citing official Axis sources, and flags any claim that is empirical/observed rather than documented.

## Standards

Documents that govern how ACAPs are scoped, built, and validated. Use them in order.

| # | Document | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | [acap-project-suitability.md](./standards/acap-project-suitability.md) | **Gate 0.** Decide whether the proposed project is appropriate to build as a custom ACAP. Do this first. |
| 2 | [acap-project-go-to-prompt.md](./standards/acap-project-go-to-prompt.md) | **Kickstart.** Reusable prompt to begin an agentic development session with the right workflow. |
| 3 | [acap-development-standards.md](./standards/acap-development-standards.md) | **Build.** Technical standards: project structure, SDK preferences, manifest conventions, security requirements. |
| 4 | [acap-security-audit.md](./standards/acap-security-audit.md) | **Validate.** Six audit prompts and checklists to review code for security, packaging, and publish readiness. |

## Guides

General-purpose reference material for ACAP development. Written for a wide audience — any ACAP developer should find these useful.

### Build and Configuration
| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [acap-manifest-gotchas.md](./guides/acap-manifest-gotchas.md) | Manifest pitfalls: schema/SDK version coupling, `settingPage` spelling, parameter group capitalization, `embeddedSdkVersion` semantics, credential param types, restart behavior |
| [acap-reverse-proxy-guide.md](./guides/acap-reverse-proxy-guide.md) | Complete reverse proxy guide: Apache forwards the full URI unchanged, manifest config, multiple access levels, debugging checklist |
| [acap-wsl-build-pitfalls.md](./guides/acap-wsl-build-pitfalls.md) | WSL2 build issues: 777 file permissions silently break the proxy, Docker BuildKit stale caches, CRLF line endings, Dockerfile template |
| [enable-unsigned-apps.md](./guides/enable-unsigned-apps.md) | Enabling unsigned ACAP installation via VAPIX `config.cgi` |

### VAPIX and Device APIs
| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [vapix-local-auth-from-acap.md](./guides/vapix-local-auth-from-acap.md) | D-Bus `GetCredentials` pattern for local VAPIX calls from an ACAP — the `127.0.0.12` virtual host, credential lifecycle, common pitfalls |
| [axis-http-authentication-policy.md](./guides/axis-http-authentication-policy.md) | Basic vs Digest auth: the `Network.HTTP.AuthenticationPolicy` setting, why forcing Digest can 401 over HTTPS, negotiate-don't-force, and the TLS trust boundary |
| [vapix-audio-device-control.md](./guides/vapix-audio-device-control.md) | Mute/unmute audio outputs via `audiodevicecontrol.cgi` — nested channel path gotcha, topology discovery pattern |

| [aoa-api-patterns.md](./guides/aoa-api-patterns.md) | AXIS Object Analytics API: scenario discovery, countable types, count retrieval, field naming by transport, polling vs. events |

### Device-Specific Hardware
| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [axis-c6110-hardware-notes.md](./guides/axis-c6110-hardware-notes.md) | C6110-E `dspcontrol` daemon and speaker-guard behavior, PipeWire node names, audio forwarding to C1110-E, paging console actions API |
